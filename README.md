ringtail-deploy-service
===================

This project is a collection of tools that live on a Ringtail machine and facilitate installations and upgrades.  It consists of two major parts - a web-service API, and a set of loosely coupled command line utilities to do installations.

##Getting Started

Build the sources, with the RingtailAutoInstaller.sln, and the InstallerService.sln.


##Contributing

In lieu of a formal style guide, please maintain consistency with style and patterns in place in the application. Add appropriate unit tests to client and server code.
